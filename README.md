# Welcome to Ryan Cross Creates Games

This is a new page that will hold information about my games and my game design work

If you're here, you might have seen my work in: 

## Wild Cross
2-4 players, ~20 mins play time
Wild Cross is a light weight, 20 mins card game for 2-4 people. Using unique triple-faceted, 5-suited cards, players compete to see who can build the biggest set from their hand in a series of quick rounds with wild rules. Each round offers the chance to recruit and win cards into their individual decks to develop a winning strategy that balances short term tactics and long term strategy - will you sacrifice a round to win the game? Each skirmish has the potential to modify the winning rules, and when incorporated into your hand has the potential to bend the skirmish to your favour.

## Kessel Run 
2-6 players, 15-30 mins play time

You're a deep space salvager, taking chances to rescue rich remains of lesser space craft. Competing against other salvagers, you'll steel yourself to chase the biggest rewards but risk too much and you'll get caught too close to the black hole, unable to escape the gravity that forms the *EVENT HORIZON*. Navigate rare minerals, dangerous hazards, and lucky comets while keeping enough fuel to get back to base. Push your luck too far though, and your only chance might be a hail-mary attempt through the heart of the black hole. 

This game references real space science, incorporates time dilation, and uncertainty principles to provide a fun experience for all players.
